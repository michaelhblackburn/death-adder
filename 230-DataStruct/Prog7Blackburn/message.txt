Computer science is more than writing code and building robots. 
It is the blending of computational principles and human creativity with the application of computing technologies.
Since its inception, computer science has revolutionized the way we compute, communicate, find information, and conduct business. 
Problem solving and logical reasoning are at the core of computer science, making it one of the most pervasive areas of study.
