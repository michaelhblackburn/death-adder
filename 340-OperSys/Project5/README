Analysis of the graphs to obtain an "optimal" block size for the system
shows an optimal block size would be 4096 bytes. While the graph shows 
an intersection of the Wasted Space and Throughput somewhere close to the
mean of 2048 and 4096 (about 3072). With a block size of 2048, we see 
excessive wasted space, about 350% greater than with a block size of
512, but with 75% less in the way of throughput. Moving up to a block 
size of 4096, we have a significant increase in wasted space over the 512 
byte block, but throughput again decreases (87.5% less) over the 512 byte
block size. As the balance falls between these two, it makes sense to 
move the block size up to gain the throughput advantage - the improvement
in performance would certainly make up for the space wasted, especially in
today's world where storage is not at a premium.
