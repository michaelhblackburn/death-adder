double throughput = sizeList[i] / (SEEK + LATENCY + ((BLOCK * blocks) / RATE);
double SEEK = 8.5; //in milliseconds
double LATENCY = 4.16; //in milliseconds
double RATE = 3000000; //in bytes/sec
int BLOCK = 4096; //in bytes
int blocks;
int num_seeks;
int total_seeks

need to calculate wasted space per file: bytes % BLOCK = wasted space per file in bytes
need to calculate number of seeks per file: num_seeks = blocks = if(bytes % BLOCK != 0){
																 	blocks = (sizeList[i] / BLOCK) + 1;
																 } 
																 else{
																 	blocks = (sizeList[i] / BLOCK);
																 }
need to calculate total number of seeks for all files: total_seeks = sum(num_seeks)


int size = 1;
if(size = sizeList[i])

calculate wasted space for each file with each block size

calculate total throughput for each block size and percentage
